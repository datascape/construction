<!--
	Expanded polystyrene (the white insulation made up of a lot of small beads bonded together) has an insulating value of 4 per inch thickness. Thus, if you used three one inch polystyrene boards together to make a wall that is 3 inches thick, the R value would be about 12, roughly 3 times better insulating than wood

## Phase 14 - STEP Warmfloor in Basement

We will probably implement basement floor heatsink during ongoing projects to coincide with solar panels:  

STEP Warmfloor gives 2.5 times more heat output than cable systems, 2.08 times more heat output than hydronic systems, and is up to 60% more efficient than conventional forced air systems. Won't dry out the air and damage your sinuses, and it holds heat longer than air systems. Warmfloor panels can be placed under wood for a gym-livingroom floor. It self-regulates so it won't overheat.

Rather than pouring more concrete on the hollow core slabs for hydronics. A thermal barrier between the basement slab and the element would add efficiency for a basement install. In the livingroom we would heat the slab during the day to radiate throughout the night, so no thermal barrier would be used under the livinging room floor surface.  


A thermal barrier between the slab and the element adds efficiency
