Loren,
If you don't have blocks available in the Atlanta area, could I pick up anywhere between Georgia, Michigan, Illinois or Canada in June?

Thank you for looking into The Perfect Block ICCF. 

I'm sorry we don't have a distributor in those areas.  Our lead time at this time is a few months so I recommend calling Rick Tindal, his information is a few paragraphs down.

We manufacture our 10 different ICCF building elements in Peoria, AZ and ship directly from our factory, throughout North America. To learn to build with ICCF, we offer our free detailed Technical Construction Manual, and in addition, we also offer tours and free ICCF construction training at one of our local job sites.
  

We encourage you to check out our Technical Construction Manual and our Sequential Pictorial, also downloadable for free on our website.

Check out our fireproof roof system in the manual that I have attached.

It's even DYI'er friendly with basic skills.

Please review the information I have attached and browse the links in our website.

 

Once you read the build manual, I recommend calling our Perfect Block ICCF expert, he'd be happy to answer any questions you may have that the build manual didn't answer:

The estimated cost to build ICCF walls is approximately $9.00 a square foot of ICCF wall when using the 10" Asymmetric block (our top-of-the-line block). This cost estimate includes 10” Asymmetric block purchase, concrete grout (at your regional prices), and rebar (#4’s, at 24” on center, at your regional prices), but this estimate excludes interior/exterior finishes, labor and shipping.  

Fire-safe, little or no bracing, no termites, can't drive a truck through it, are great things for a house built for the 21st century and beyond. Another great thing about this block is that you can also make a "safe room" from storms or a vault for valuables or use our 6” block to replace interior partition walls to isolate areas in your home for soundproofing.  This block can stand up to winds of 250 mph.  ICCF is 8 times stronger than building with wood.  

The Perfect Block (TPB) can be used for exterior walls, foundation walls, basement walls, retaining walls, round walls, fences, arches, outdoor living construction, landscaping, roofs, pilasters, columns, and interior partition walls for the entire house (your imagination is your only limitation). But the above-grade wall is where it shines above all others in respect to energy-efficiency and temperature control. Eco Building Systems destroys the myth that “gray block” ICF/ICCF costs more than wood framing. The Perfect Block costs less than wood framing, creates a fireproof, super-insulated house that will be still standing even when a wildfire fire passes through (for complete protection: roof, soffits, windows, and doors must be adequately protected).


 

To get a rough calculation of blocks needed:

To calculate # of block = total linear feet of wall X height of wall = total wall sf – (square feet of windows and doors) = total wall sf w/o openings,

add 2% sf for waste,  Total sf  + (Total sf x .02 =  ?) = total sf for block calc

divide by 4 sf = total # of block,  (There is 4 sq. foot of wall in every block.)
Choose the core size and thickness of block you want for the price.

# of blocks x price per block = block cost

count corners X height of walls, divide by 4 = # of corner blocks.

# of corner blocks x price per block = corner block cost

plus shipping, call Rick to get an estimate.

 

 R Values:

10” Asymmetric ICCF– R32, without including the thermal mass multiplier

10” Symmetric 6”x6” Core ICCF – R27

8” ICCF – R24

We, as a company, have opted to use HERS ratings as a measure of the energy performance of a total structure as a true test of energy efficiency. This is the reason we have not emphasized R Values in our literature or on our website. R Values, high or low are not a precise measurement of efficiency.

R values are listed for our exterior wall block in our build manual.

 

If you go to YouTube and type in a search for "The Perfect Block" and study the videos, you may pick up some ideas and tips.

 

Here's a video that was sent to me about The Perfect Block. 

It's rough with the wind in the beginning but it is very educational.  

This architect doesn't work for us, just loves The Perfect Block ICCF:

***On a personal note:  I am an owner/builder of a house made of this product, (that's how I got involved with working with the company)  I believe in this product!  I will never live in a conventional build again!  My house is so solid and quiet. This home is 5500' under roof:  I had R-50 put in my ceilings to match my wall system!  Here is my build:
