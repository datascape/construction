### Wall for relocated gas pipe and new vent pipes

Upstairs wall portion added first for gas pipe and vent pipes for refrigerators.<br>
Water heater will be moved into attic by removing beam near attic ladder. 

Gas pipe currently runs through kitchen pantries.  
Work can coincide with walls and plumbing for new downstairs bathroom.  
 
- Open downstairs north wall in coat closet for new pipe. 
- Pipe will reside in repositioned bathroom wall upstairs.
- Run pipe under plywood in attic to furnace.
- Send gas to the water heater from above by reversing the flow of the pipe that currently goes to furnace in the attic.  
- Cap off former gas link at water heater.  
- Also remove unused gas pipe under porch to create more usable storage space.
