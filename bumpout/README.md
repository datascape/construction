#Bumpout  

## Shed Roof

Size: 16' 9" by 18' 9" (expanded to 26' 10")  


## HVAC

Moving new units to pads outside fence  

New freon is called 4-10-A  

UPSTAIRS

Existing outside R-22 AC unit has a leak in valve, so can't pump R22 freon down to reattach unless valve replaced.  All R22 freon has already been removed, so refilling could be 7 lbs at $120/lb = $840.

Downstairs - 

Outside R22 unit is loud.
2.5 Ton, 90,000 BTU Horizontal Coil
Carrier Comfort Series quote from Daniel: 5,900 + 1,700 labor = $7,600
Earl says we have a Leno unit in basement

### Unit Serving Upstairs

<!--
AC Repair Project - I'm looking for someone to replace a leaking service valve in an R22 unit so we can pump the freon down when relocating it. We're not able to read the label so we're not sure of the brand. It's been working well otherwise. It's connected to 3 ton, 90,000 BTU. Also interested in buying a quite running R22 for a 2.5 ton, 90,000 BTU system.
