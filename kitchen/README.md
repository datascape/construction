## Interior Prep

After bumpout of exterior wall and addition of new north windows:  

- Create envelope of plastic within room to prevent any dust from moving into house or falling between floor boards. 
- Remove gas and water pipe within pantry (disconnected in prior phase). 
- Carefully remove and retain door trim and baseboards from interior walls.  
- Remove ceiling plaster and slats from both kitchen and craft room.  
- Tie slats in bundles to prevent puncturing contrator bags.  
- Remove old pipes from within south wall of kitchen.  
- Retain both sinks for now.  
- Park disposal truck on bass for debris. (We'll save some of the slats and wood). 
- On both levels, remove ceiling plaster and one side of south wall.
- On both levels, remove ceiling slats. Add braces between ceiling beams to add stability.  
- On both levels, remove previous exterior north wall of kitchen and craftroom.
- DO NOT remove either side of exterior west wall at this stage.

Ikea comparable to more expensive custom cabinet makers.
Make sure Ikea surface quality is consistent. 
Ceasarstone - most durable

Jill Blass has Shaker-style panels.
Mark Mroz (fancywoodworks.com) builds shelves and custom cabinets, and the cost is only a little more than Ikea.
He assembles it all from wood and uses his spray shop.
