Connect new freon pipe from under house.  
Attach pipe under HVAC in attic.


### Upstairs

All R22 freon has already been removed. Use $50/lb R425a to refill. <!-- New freon is called 4-10-A  -->  
Existing outside R-22 AC unit has a leak in valve, so can't pump R22 freon down to reattach unless valve replaced.  
Attic HVAC: 3 Ton, 90,000 BTU

<!-- so refilling could be 7 lbs at $120/lb = $840. -->

<!--
AC Repair Project - I'm looking for someone to replace a leaking service valve in an R22 unit so we can pump the freon down when relocating it. We're not able to read the label so we're not sure of the brand. It's been working well otherwise. It's connected to 3 ton, 90,000 BTU. Also interested in buying a quite running R22 for a 2.5 ton, 90,000 BTU system.

Patch exterior holes with Type O mortar mix (For south side, use Holcim Atlanta Red with sand and lime added)

Brackers for hanging shovels reside on north side of chminey.  

Later, energy could be generated during drip irrigation on cloudy days by turning a small turbine with the descending water.  Turbine could by bypassed when higher pressure is used to water lawn. 2 antique tanks within the backside of the fireplace could hold additional water.
