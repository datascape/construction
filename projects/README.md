## AC Move

Moving AC units to pads outside fence, relocating pipe line set in attic and on side of house.<br><br>
<a href="img/hvac-pipes/overhead.jpg"><img src="img/hvac-pipes/overhead.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width:500px"></a><br><br>

1. Detach and reattach 7/8" line set at back of attic HVAC to move under HVAC. (Currently goes over top of HVAC.)  Pipes have already been cut about 10 feet away from HVAC.  (Outside, the 7/8" pipe becomes 3/4" where it enters AC.)

2. Add a 90° elbow to the top of verticle 7/8" pipe. We can either lay the pipe on the ground and solder a 91" pipe to the top to feed through a widened opening under the eve, or feed down from above and solder it on the side of the house.<br><br>

3. Connect line set in attic. (7/8" diameter)  

4. Extend 3/4" pipe from under house 108". We have removed brick so it will not be necessary to go under house. (Currently 74" pipe goes from under house to AC). Place new pipe in 3" PVC.

5. Add an elbow at bottom of verticle pipe from attic.

6. Place both AC lines in the 4" elbow. Connect.

7. Run line sets in PVC to AC units outside fence.<br><br>

8. Add 3/4" pipe valves to disconnected unit. Johnstone Supply Atlanta is transfering for us from their other store. 

9. Move AC serving upstairs. All R22 freon has already been removed.<br>
Unit has a leak in valve that prevented soldering. Earl says we can solder it now that all freon is removed.<br><br>
Earl was told by the supply store that we could use $50/lb R425a or similar to refill.<br>
Johnstone Supply Atlanta told Loren they use 407c, 427a, MO99 based on the pressure. Said to flush whole system for oil.  

10. Move AC serving downstairs. This one is currently working. Confirm upstairs AC is functional before disconnecting downstairs AC. Pump down freon. Add 3/4" pipe valve when reconnecting.

#### HVACs

<!-- New freon for a new unit is called 4-10-A, but Earl says an even newer freon is coming soon.  --> 

Upstairs HVAC: 3 Ton, 90,000 BTU

<!--
AC Repair Project - I'm looking for someone to replace a leaking service valve in an R22 unit so we can pump the freon down when relocating it. We're not able to read the label so we're not sure of the brand. It's been working well otherwise. It's connected to 3 ton, 90,000 BTU. Also interested in buying a quite running R22 for a 2.5 ton, 90,000 BTU system.

## Repointing Bricks

### Exterior south side

Repointing exterior could be separate from crawlspace. Simon mentioned a tan shade.  
Repair crawlspace vent openings around house for tight fit. We have replacement vents.  

### Crawlspace

We have ingredients for Type O mortar mix already.  
1. Place aluminum under wood (avoid nailing). Bend far edge down 1/2 inch first - prevents termites. 
2. Add Type O mortar and bricks on top edges within crawlspace - up to aluminum.  
3. Bend close edge of aluminum after adding mortar.  

Northwest corner - Add bricks to seal behind PVC board. Use small jack if needed.  

For minor patches in tall columns, we might use Holcim Atlanta Red with sand and lime added.

## Porch wood widths

Need 3/4" by 4" pressure treated (green) wood - 8' or more

Pieces are 45" long. We need 34 pieces. So 16 8-foot, plus extras.

The wood we have is 1/16" too short. But that is okay since we will replace entire areas by door.

## Metal support poles in crawlspace

Dig holes, add cement for 2 to 6 columns
Add support poles with aluminum at top

- One beside porch
- One under new bathroom
- West side of house, kitchen  
- Entrance room wall

## Siding repairs and caulking for painting 

Northwest corner caulk  
Nail holes and other repairs around house  

## Porch floor

Replace wood floor by front door  
Working on hatch door for front porch  



## Mortar Mix


Sandy darker grey mortar color in center below.  
Use a mix of buff and charcole pigment (Too much buff becomes orange.)  
We have pigment, sand, lime, and Type N to mix for softer Type O.  
See [Mortar Mix for Historic Homes](https://gpna.org/historic-home-care)<br><br>

Our existing mortar and bricks are too red. Wall looks fine...<br>

Brackets for hanging shovels reside on north side of chiminey.  

Later, energy could be generated during drip irrigation on cloudy days by turning a small turbine with the descending water.  Turbine could by bypassed when higher pressure is used to water lawn. 2 antique tanks within the backside of the fireplace could hold additional water.
