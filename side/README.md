# Side Foundation

<h2>Phase 1 - Side Cement Foundation and AC Enclosure</h2>

The project includes cutting and removing 15' of an existing sidewalk for recessed AC area.

Recessed area will be approximately 1.5 foot below ground level.  

60' long drainage pipe to road: Possibly 10" or 12" diameter concrete pipe. Includes a 135 degree downward bend 10' from street.  Include a box with a T to a 3" PVC pipe (with access cap) for sending water into frontyard ivy slope during light rains.

Might use removed sidewalk as fill under the 3.5' bumpout concrete slab (as long as that would not weaken the slab).
